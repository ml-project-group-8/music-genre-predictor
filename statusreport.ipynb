    "Our goal is to predict the genre of a song based on various features extracted by Spotify. This is interesting as it could allow for automated music playlists and can be used to determine which of these features are the most important for a specific genre."

    "### Data: [copied from proposal, may need updating]\n",
    "The data is generated from Spotify’s API. We found a 2000-2018 Billboard Hot 100 songs dataset that uses Spotify’s API to extract song features. The dataset contains additional features that are generated by Spotify, as well as features inherent to the song. We would need to investigate some of the features generated by Spotify to determine if they are suitable for the genre classification.\n"

    "### Features:\n",
    "The are 10 features are song duration, energy, liveliness, tempo, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, loudness, time signature, and lyrics. The definitions of each of these features are defined below. </br>  \n",
    "_Duration_: The duration of the track in milliseconds. </br>  \n",
    "_Energy_: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. </br>  \n",
    "Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live. </br>  \n",
    "_Tempo_: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. </br>  \n",
    "_Speechines_: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. </br>  \n",
    "_Acousticness_: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic. </br>  \n",
    "_Instrumentalness_: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. </br>  \n",
    "_Loudness_: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db. </br>  \n",
    "Speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. </br>  \n",
    "_Time Signature_: int\tAn estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). </br>  \n",
    "_Lyrics_: words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses </br>  \n"
